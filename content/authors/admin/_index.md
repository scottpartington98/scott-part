I'm a PhD student in Philosophy of Science at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.hps.cam.ac.uk). My PhD research is supervised by [Marta Halina](https://www.martahalina.com) and funded by the [British Society for Philosophy of Science](https://www.thebsps.org). Previously, I studied at Cambridge (MPhil, Philosophy of Science) and Cornell (BA, Psychology). I also conduct research in experimental philosophy with collaborators at Cornell: [Shaun Nichols](https://sites.google.com/view/shaunbnichols/home) and [Alejandro Vesga](https://alejandrovesga.co).
